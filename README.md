# ChallengeJembi

This program was developed in react and JavaScript, which allows adding items to a shopping list. The component includes various states, such as the quantity and priority of the product, as well as the shopping list itself. Users can add products to the list, sort it by priority and delete them. The component also includes a search field to filter the shopping list by product name. The component uses a JSON file with the names of the products for the user to select.
